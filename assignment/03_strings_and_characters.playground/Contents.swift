// Note that not all 21-bit Unicode scalar values are assigned to a character ‚Äî some scalars are reserved for future assignment or for use in UTF-16 encoding.

// Extended grapheme clusters can be composed of multiple Unicode scalars. This means that different characters ‚Äî and different representations of the same character ‚Äî can require different amounts of memory to store. Because of this, characters in Swift don‚Äôt each take up the same amount of memory within a string‚Äôs representation. As a result, the number of characters in a string can‚Äôt be calculated without iterating through the string to determine its extended grapheme cluster boundaries. If you are working with particularly long string values, be aware that the count property must iterate over the Unicode scalars in the entire string in order to determine the characters for that string.
// Each String value has an associated index type, String.Index, which corresponds to the position of each Character in the string.
// As mentioned above, different characters can require different amounts of memory to store, so in order to determine which Character is at a particular position, you must iterate over each Unicode scalar from the start or end of that String. For this reason, Swift strings can‚Äôt be indexed by integer values.
// Use the startIndex property to access the position of the first Character of a String. The endIndex property is the position after the last character in a String. As a result, the endIndex property isn‚Äôt a valid argument to a string‚Äôs subscript. If a String is empty, startIndex and endIndex are equal.
// You access the indices before and after a given index using the index(before:) and index(after:) methods of String. To access an index farther away from the given index, you can use the index(_:offsetBy:) method instead of calling one of these methods multiple times.
// You can use subscript syntax to access the Character at a particular String index.

}

// You can use the startIndex and endIndex properties and the index(before:), index(after:), and index(_:offsetBy:) methods on any type that conforms to the Collection protocol. This includes String, as shown here, as well as collection types such as Array, Dictionary, and Set.

// To insert a single character into a string at a specified index, use the insert(_:at:) method, and to insert the contents of another string at a specified index, use the insert(contentsOf:at:) method.
var welcome = "hello"
welcome.insert("!", at: welcome.endIndex)
welcome.insert(contentsOf: " there", at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))

// When you get a substring from a string ‚Äî for example, using a subscript or a method like prefix(_:) ‚Äî the result is an instance of Substring, not another string. Substrings in Swift have most of the same methods as strings, which means you can work with substrings the same way you work with strings. However, unlike strings, you use substrings for only a short amount of time while performing actions on a string. When you‚Äôre ready to store the result for a longer time, you convert the substring to an instance of String.
var greeting = "hello, world!"
var index = greeting.firstIndex(of: ",") ?? greeting.endIndex
var beginning = greeting[..<index]
let newGreeting = String(beginning)

// Like strings, each substring has a region of memory where the characters that make up the substring are stored. The difference between strings and substrings is that, as a performance optimization, a substring can reuse part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store the original string, or part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store another substring. (Strings have a similar optimization, but if two strings share memory, they‚Äôre equal.) This performance optimization means you don‚Äôt have to pay the performance cost of copying memory until you modify either the string or substring. As mentioned above, substrings aren‚Äôt suitable for long-term storage ‚Äî because they reuse the storage of the original string, the entire original string must be kept in memory as long as any of its substrings are being used.

// Swift provides three ways to compare textual values: string and character equality, prefix equality, and suffix equality.
// String and character equality is checked with the ‚Äúequal to‚Äù operator (==) and the ‚Äúnot equal to‚Äù operator (!=).
// Two String values (or two Character values) are considered equal if their extended grapheme clusters are canonically equivalent. Extended grapheme clusters are canonically equivalent if they have the same linguistic meaning and appearance, even if they‚Äôre composed from different Unicode scalars behind the scenes.

// String and character comparisons in Swift aren‚Äôt locale-sensitive.

// To check whether a string has a particular string prefix or suffix, call the string‚Äôs hasPrefix(_:) and hasSuffix(_:) methods, both of which take a single argument of type String and return a Boolean value.
// The hasPrefix(_:) and hasSuffix(_:) methods perform a character-by-character canonical equivalence comparison between the extended grapheme clusters in each string.
